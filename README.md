## About Me

I am an aspiring frontend developer with a strong interest in UI design, visual systems, and creative technologies.  
My background in photography and design influences how I approach frontend development, with attention to structure, usability, and visual consistency.

I am currently strengthening my skills in React and modern frontend tooling, while exploring how design thinking can be translated into maintainable, production-ready code.  
I am particularly interested in collaborative environments and opportunities that support continuous learning and professional growth.
